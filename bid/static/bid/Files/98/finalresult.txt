ASPA reserves the right to require such additional information, samples and, if prac
ticable, demonstration 
of items offered as may be necessary to allow a full and complete evaluation of all Quotations. Samples 
and/or demonstrations will be supplied promptly and free of charge to ASPA. Failure to provide samples 
within a set of business d
ays agreed upon by both parties may be grounds for Quotation rejection. Samples 
will upon request, and if not destroyed by testing, be returned at the Offeror's expense. 
 
 
The responsibility to determine the equivalence of quality and performance of any it
em offered to the 
specifications established for this Invitation rests solely with ASPA and its decision shall be final.

Contractor agrees to investigate, defend and hold ASPA harmless from and against any and all loss, damage, 
liability, claims, demands, detriments, cost, charges and expense (including attorney's fees), and causes of 
action of whatsoever character which
 
ASPA may incur, sustain or be subjected to, arising out of or in any 
way connected to the services to be performed by Contractor or subcontractor under this Contract and 
arising from any cause, except the sole negligence of ASPA.

ASPA reserves the right to waive any minor irregula

submitting alternate Quotations when called for.  A party who has proposed prices on materials is not 
thereby disqualified from quoting prices to other Offerors or from submitting a Quotation directly to ASPA. 
 
 
If ASPA believes that collusion exists among
 
any Offerors, none of the participants in such collusion shall
