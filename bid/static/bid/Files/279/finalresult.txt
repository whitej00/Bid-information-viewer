Corrupt and Fraudulent Practices
 
The Co
ntracting Authority and the suppliers, contractors, subcontractors, consultants or subconsultants 
must observe the highest standard of ethics during the procurement process and performance of the 
contract. The Contracting Authority means the Purchaser, the
 
Employer, the Client, as the case may 
be, for the procurement of goods, works, plants, consulting services or non

consulting services.
 
By signing the Statement of Integrity the suppliers, contractors, subcontractors, consultants or 
subconsultants declare

Moreover, AFD requires including in the Procurement Documents and AFD
-
financed contracts a 
provision requiring that suppliers, contractors, subcontractors,
 
consultants or subconsultants will permit 
AFD to inspect their accounts and records relating to the procurement process and performance of the 
AFD
-
financed contract, and to have them audited by auditors appointed by AFD. 
 
AFD reserves the right to take an
y action it deems appropriate to check that these ethics rules are 
observed and reserves, in particular, the rights to:
 
a)
 
Reject a proposal for a contract award if it is established that during the selection process the 
bidder or consultant that is recommend
ed for the award has been convicted of corruption, directly 
or by means of an agent, or has engaged in fraud or anti
-
competitive practices in view of being 
awarded the Contract;
 
b)
 
Declare misprocurement when it is established that, at any time, the Contracti
ng Authority, the 
suppliers, contractors, subcontractors, consultants or subconsultants their representatives have 
engaged in acts of corruption, fraud or anti
-
competitive practices during the procurement process 
or performance of the contract without the 
Contracting Authority having taken appropriate action 
in due time satisfactory to AFD to remedy the situation, including by failing to inform AFD at the 
time they knew of such practices.
 
AFD defines, for the purposes of this provision, the terms set forth 
below as follows:
 
a)
 
Corruption of a Public Officer means:
 

 
The act of promising, offering or giving to a Public Officer, directly or indirectly, an undue 
advantage of any kind for himself or for another Person
1
 
or entity, for such Public Officer to 
act or ref
rain from acting in his official capacity; or
 

 
The act by which a Public Officer solicits or accepts, directly or indirectly, an undue 
advantage of any kind for himself or for another Person or entity, for such Public Officer to 
act or refrain from acting i
n his official capacity.
 
b)
 
A Public Officer shall be construed as meaning: 
 

 
Any person who holds a legislative, executive, administrative or judicial mandate (within 
the country of the Contracting Authority) regardless of whether that natural Person was 
nomi
nated or elected, regardless of the permanent or temporary, paid or unpaid nature of 
the position and regardless of the hierarchical level the natural Person occupies;
 

 
Any other natural Person who performs a public function, including for a State instituti
on or 
a State
-
owned company, or who provides a public service;

Description of the Works
 
 
The Applicants are requested to focus on i/ quality of project, ii/ cost optimizations and iii/ schedule. 
 
 
For the hybrid power plant
s
 
and its connection
s
 
to th
e mini
-
grid
s
, IEC standard shall be used for design. 
For civil works, the design has to be compliant with Kenyan standards. 
 
 
The main technical choices for the power hybrid plants will be defined 
in 
the 
ensuing Proposal Stage 
(conceptual design done by th
e Retrofitting Program Technical Assistant; to be included in the 
proposal 
RFB
 
d
ocuments). However, this conceptual design must be considered by the Tenderers as the 
minimum requirements for the tender stage. Improvements will be expected in terms of compo
nent and 
architecture.

/ Security
 
 
Some sites are located in areas (northern and eastern parts of the country), for which travel is not 
recommended by some foreign 
counties 
offices, for security reasons. The candidates will take this fact 
into consideration.
 
During th
e Request 
f
or Proposal phase, the pre
-
selected candidates will have to describe the measures 
they intend to put in place to ensure the safety of the
ir
 
personnel considering that Kenya Power has 
adopted a Security plan for Northern Region off
-
grid power sta
tions. For obvious security reasons, this 
document is confidential and will therefore only be circulated to the selected bidder(s). In order to 
facilitate the quotation of the security measures to be considered during the 
Proposal
 
phase, some 
information w
ill be shared with the pre selected candidates to ensure the compliance with KPLC 
security
 
policy in term of 
(i) 
security briefing, 
(ii) 
means of communication, 
(iii) 
transport, 
(iv) 
working hours, 
(v) 
insurance
, etc.
