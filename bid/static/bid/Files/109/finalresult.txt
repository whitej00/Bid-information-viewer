later found not to comply with the provisions of the Contract. All estimated quantities 
of work
 
for which partial payments have been made are subject to review and 
correction on the final estimate. Payment by ASPA and acceptance by the Contractor 
of partial payments based on periodic estimates of quantities of work performed

onstitute acceptance of the estimated quantities used as the 
basis for computing the amount of the partial payments.
 
Before the first working day of each calendar month, the Contractor shall prepare a 
detailed estimate of the amount earned for the separate
 
portions of the work for 
review and approval by ASPA.  As used in this Section, the words "amount earned"

completed in accordance with the Contract and the value of approved mat
erials

delivered to the site, but not incorporated in the work, it shall be necessary for the 
Contractor to submit
 
to the Engineer, at least seven (7) days prior to the end of said 
month, a list of such materials. At his sole discretion, the Engineer will approve items

net cost for the materials. Proper storage and protection shall be 
provided by the Contractor, and as approved by an ASPA engineer.  Final payment 
shall be made only for materials actually incorporated in the work and, upon 
acceptance of the work, all mat
