 SCOPE OF WORK  
I. Scope 
The American Samoa Power Authority issues this Request for Proposal for A/E services from a 
professional consultant with experience in designing Wastewater, Sewage Pump Stations and 
Sewage Collection Systems. The design shall include all process control, mechanical, electrical, and 

structural components and related appurtenances to allow the facilities to be functional and 

operable according to ASPA maintenance and operation capabilities and requirements. 
Appurtenances shall include but will not necessarily be limited to access facilities, fencing, lighting, 
water connections, and power supply including emergency power.  The design shall be in accordance 

with Ten States Standards, Wastewater Pollution Control Federation, USEPA, or other comparable 
standards.   The proposal shall include all personnel, travel, equipment, supplies, overhead, and 
related costs necessary to complete the following Scope of Work (SOW). 
 If required design new pumps and other appurtenances including plumbing modifications and 
control panel upgrades necessary for the Fatu-ma-Futi/Hospital pump station to accommodate 
the addition of flows from the new project service area. 
II. Location 
Avau 
to Fatumafuti area.  
 i. Background 
American Samoa is comprised of several islands including Tutuila, Tau, Ofu, Olosega, and Aunuu.  The islands 
have a combined population of approximately 60,000 with nearly all population residing on Tutuila. The 
current population of American Samoa is 55,155 as of October 2020 based on the latest united nations 
estimates. Nearly 20 miles long and between one and six miles wide, Tutuila is the largest island of the group 
ASPA21.003 A/E SERVICE FOR DESIGN & PERMITTING OF
 A COMMUNITY WW COLLECTION SYSTEM pg. 28 with the remaining islands each significantly smaller. The islands are located approximately 2600 miles south-
southwest of Hawaii and 1800 miles north-northeast from New Zealand. 
a. The villages of Avau
, Faganeanea, Matuu and Fatumafuti

Central 

(ESV) for this project are located on the island of Tutuila along the northern and eastern shoreline of 
Pago Pago Harbor.  Current population for the area is 550 based on a 
2010 census. The projected 
20-year planning period population is estimated to be approximately 750.   Currently there is no 

wastewater infrastructure for Faganeanea/Matuu or for its small neighboring villages of Avau and 

Fatumafuti. Efforts at workable on-site wastewater management in these villages are impeded by 

population density, topography, soils characteristics and complex village land tenure among 
residents. High population density is the principal factor that exacerbates the difficulties of effective 
on-site wastewater management in this area where there is little build-able land, soils have high 
permeability, and land ownership is sometimes in dispute. 
 b. Recent Water quality monitoring report can be obtained from American Samoa Environmental 
Protection Agency (ASEPA). The villages of this area routinely consume fish and shellfish from the 

embayment, and also use these waters extensively for recreational activities. Given the risks to the 
public, and the lack of practicable on-site wastewater treatment for this village embayment area, it 
is important to mitigate non-point source wastewater impacts by connecting the project to the 

existing ASPA wastewater treatment and disposal system 

 c. The Utulei Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located on the South side of the Harbor. The 

WWTP currently serves the sewered areas from the canneries to the hospital.  Together the two 
canneries contribute significantly to the flows, since all wastewater except process wastewater is 
discharged to the ASPA sanitary sewers. Each cannery has designated wastewater treatment for 
canning process water only which does not include sanitary wastewater flows.  Other flows to the 

Utulei WWTP are primarily domestic waste with contributions from schools, small businesses and 

government buildings including the hospital.  The collected wastewater is sent through multiple 
pump stations to the WWTP. Utulei WWTP is a primary treatment plant with a basket screen, manual 
bar screens, and 4 stacked primary clarifier and anaerobic digester units called clarigesters.  After the 

clarigesters, the effluent passes through a chlorine contact chamber, a sampling and flow monitoring 

station and into the outfall for diffusion into Pago Pago Harbor. The plant operates on a 301(h)-
modified National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. This permit does not 
specify a maximum permitted flow. This plant has sufficient capacity to accept the additional flows 

from the proposed service area. 
 d. The Utulei WWTP was originally constructed in 1975 which included two clarigesters (No.s 1 and 2).  
It underwent expansion in 1994 with the addition of two more clarigesters (No.s 3 and 4).  The 1992 

drawings for the expanded WWTP indicate a rated average daily flow capacity of 2.2 mgd and peak 
daily flow of 6.13 mgd.  
 e. The Fatumafuti Pump (Lift) Station currently has one 3-hp pumps that can pump between 
70gpm to 
90gpm.  
 f. The Hospital Pump (Lift) Station currently has two 7.5-hp pumps that can pump between 2
00 gpm to 
231gpm.  

 ii. The evaluation shall include: 
1. Review of as-builts. 
2. Field confirmation of existing data including pipe diameter, pipe material, and  condition 
of pipe, slopes and ground and invert elevations. 

3. Measurement of existing flows. 
4. If the existing sewer main cannot accommodate 20 year design flows, the consultant shall 
design a replacement system.  The replacement system shall be designed such that it will follow the 
ASPA21.003 A/E SERVICE FOR DESIGN & PERMITTING OF
 A COMMUNITY WW COLLECTION SYSTEM pg. 29 same general route to the WWTP and be able to accommodate flows from the Lift Station over a 20-
year design period. 
  The system shall be designed such that it can be placed into operation without 
interrupting service to customers as provided by the existing sewer main.   

 iii. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System 
 SCADA/PLC/CLOUD
 1. The design shall include measures and components to allow the pumping stations designed 
under this RFP to be connected to and monitored by the existing ASPA SCADA/PLC/CLOUD 
System.  The design shall be coordinated with the ASPA SCADA technician.  
iv.
 Restoration and Repair 
1. The design shall include all necessary restoration and/or repair for existing paved roads, utilities, 
drive ways, curbs, sidewalks, walls, fences and other infrastructure that may need to be removed 
and/or replaced to install the facilities designed and constructed under this RFP.   Lawns, gardens and 
other items that may pose an obstruction will be included in restoration.  
 v. Erosion Control and Drainage 
1. Erosion control and drainage measures and facilities shall be included in the design including drainage 
structures, retaining walls, pipe dams, stream bed protection and other elements that will ensure 
erosion control and drainage is accomplished according to best management practices applied for 
similar projects or infrastructure.   

 vi.
 Septic Tank Decommissioning 
1. A plan for decommissioning 
of septic systems will be prepared to allow uninterrupted wastewater 
disposal from homes and other structures to be connected to the new sewer system.  
vii.
 Geotechnical Evaluation 
The consultant shall conduct a geotechnical evaluation of selected areas along the proposed collection system 
route utilizing equipment rented by ASPA, including equipment operators, to allow.   
 determination of soil conditions, including presence of rock, and the impact of findings on design, 
construction, and maintenance.
