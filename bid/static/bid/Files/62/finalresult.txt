 7.1.3 33KV Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) 
7.1.3.1 SwitchgearŒDesign and Performance: 
33 KV gas insulated switchgear shall be suitable for 
indoor location and capable of continuous operation 
under the climatic conditions existing on site. It shall 
be designed to comply with this Specification and 
relevant IEC Standards. In all cases  the  ancillary  plant  necessary  to  comple
te  installation  of  the  equipment  shall be included 
in the Contract. 
The disposition of plant in any substation is to be su
ch that the operation of any item of plant under the 
specified service conditions shall in no way create a 
condition that could adversely affect the performance 
of adjacent circuit breakers or any associated equipment. 
The Contractor is to ensure that th
e complete substation installation will satisfy the requirements of this 
Specification and the appropriate Standards in respect of
 insulation, fault levels, 
mechanical stress etc., and any  additional  equipment  found  to  be necessary to meet these requirements shall be deemed to have 

been included in the Contract Price. 
The layout and design of plant and equipment on s
ubstation sites shall make provision for the future 
extensions of  same capacity substation shown  on  th
e  layout  drawings  and shall provide for ready access 
for operation, maintenance and exte
nsion whilst the remaining sections of equipment are alive. Working 
clearances provided between isolated equipment and 
nearest live metal work shall not be less than the 
British Standard section clearances. 
Insulation creep age  distances  shall  not  be  less  
than  25mm  per  KV  rated  voltage between phases. 
The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that
 insulation co-ordination  in accordance with 
recommendation of IEC-71 is achieved. Dynamic and te
mporary over voltages shall be assumed to be in 
accordance with normally accepted IEC levels. 
The 33 KV Gas Insulated switchgear with circuit breake
rs having vacuum  interruption facility shall  be  
Indoor,  Metal  clad,  dust  &  vermin  proof,  fa
ctory  assembled,  type  tested,protected against 
condensation and aggressive gases, single busbar 
and single phase encapsulated or three phase 
encapsulated.  All  high  voltage  components/  parts  
must   be fully gas insulated sealed hermetically and 
safe-to- touch.  The Switchgear  (primary section) pa
nel shall be filled with insulating gas at site or in 
factory and  fitted  with gas monitoring device with 
contact. SF6 may be used as an insulating medium, not 
for quenching. 
All control and monitoring elements shou
ld be accessible from the front. 
The arrangement of the Circuit-breaker in  the  panel  must  be  such  that  in  the  event  of any necessary 
inspections both the operating mechanism and the arc chambers can be removed and reinstalled from the 

front or back in a  verifiably  short  time.  The bus  bars must remain in uninterrupted operation and there 
must be no reduction in either the insulation level (a
dditional measures such as protective barriers are not 
permitted) or personal safety. Confirmation must be provided with the quotation. 
Each sealed-off gas compartment must have its own pre
ssure relief facility, which in event of arcing fault 
prevents uncontrolled rupturing of the compartment.  The manufacturer must guarantee an adequate 

pressure reserve between the operating value of the pressure relief and the rupturing pressure of the 
vessels. The pressure relief facilities must limit the e
ffects of a fault arc to one compartment. Gas escaping 
under pressure must divert in a direction that is no
t dangerous for operating personnel; the same applies 
 Bid Doc for Khulna 33kV GIS SS(Vol-2 of 2)       168                  
                                      SPDSP, WZPDCL 
  to fixed parts (rupture diaphragms etc). 
Pressure monitoring takes  place  with  contact-maki
ng  manometer  gauges with scale, which function 
independently for each bus bar section, three-positi
on switch gas compartment or bus bar  voltage  
transformer  set  respectively  or  temperature co
mpensated gas sensors for each gas compartment, which 
shall be equipped with  self-supervision. The gas pressure gauge shall be installed at the front of the 

switchgear panel and shall be easily visible. 
 The gas compartments must be well sealed both mutu
ally and to their surroundings. The gas loss must 
not exceed 0.1% per year and compar
tment. The filling pressure must be
 selected so that after thirty 
years of operation the full test voltages ca
n still be withstand, without any topping up. 
The use of plastics must be minimized, in order to likew
ise minimize the risk of fire in the event of a fault. 
The Current transformer must be of the di-electrically non-stressed ring type mounted outside the gas 
compartment and shall be easily replaceable without gas work. 
The Voltage transformer for both bus bar and incomer 
shall be of plug-in-design separate housing filled 
with SF6  gas to be connected to the bus bar and loca
ted outside of the gas enclosure and disconnect able 
by a three position isolation switch. 
Cable termination shall be totally insulated. Provision sh
ould be kept for plug-in connection of at least two 
cables per phase. 
The LV compartment shall be made of high quality sh
eet steel with powdered coated painting with 
sufficient space for mounting secondary equipment. 
The complete switchgear must be compact 
in dimension as space is very limited. 
Interlocking between the Circuit breaker and three position switch should meet the following conditions: 
 to prevent the disconnector from switching under load, 
 they  may  only  be  actuated with the circuit-
breaker open 
 the three-position switch must be prevented from switching through from the closed state in to the 
ﬁready-to-earthﬂ position. 
 the three-position switch can only be brought into the 
earthing  position  if  the circuit breaker is open. 
 closing of the circuit-breaker must be blocked for as
 long as the three position switch has not reached a 
definite switching position. 
 for earthing of the feeder, reliable ﬁinterrogation interlockingﬂ must be provided. Only the three-
position switch  is  switched  into  the  ﬁready-t
o-earthﬂ  position,  feeder  can be earthed and short-
circuited by closing the circuit-breaker. 
Gas compartment must be provided  with  gas  pressure  monitoring  by  pressure  gauge with signaling 
contacts, to signal any increase drop of gas pressure. 
The individual panels are to be connected by solid
 insulated, plug-in bus bars outside the SF6 Gas 
compartment. The bus bar is to be located in a metal-
clad compartment. The bus bar is to be located in a 
metal-clad compartment. 
The switchgear must be extendable at both ends 
of the bus bars. The incoming and outgoing switchgear 
panel width shall not be more than 600 mm 
to ensure the proper use of space. 
The Vacuum Circuit Breaker as a making/breaking uni
t,  including  operating  mechanism, must be 
maintenance free. 
 
The three-position disconnector (ON-OFFŒEARTH) is to reduce the number of functional elements within 
the encapsulation and together with the circuit breaker,  provide  make- proof earthing. 
In order to reduce the  number  of  mechanical  parts 
 within  the  encapsulation,  the operating shafts are 
 Bid Doc for Khulna 33kV GIS SS(Vol-2 of 2)       169                  
                                      SPDSP, WZPDCL 
  to be located outside the encapsulation. The switches
 are to be operated without a seal via gas-tight 
welded-in bushings. 
The material of the SF6 containers is to consist of
 non-corroding high-quality steel or aluminium. The live 
parts are to be insulated against the earthed housing by SF6  gas. 
The Transformers are to be exchange
able toroidal-core or ring type transformers which are to be used 
outside the SF6 encapsulation so that they are not exposed to dielectric stress. 
The cable terminals of the 3-Phases are to be located 
horizontally next to one another on one level and are 
to be easily accessible from the front or rear. 
High Voltage Section 
 The High Voltage section must be maintenance free and immune to environmental influences. The 
installation must be resistant to accidental arcs. 
All switches  are  to  be  operated  from  the  fr
ont.  The circuit breakers must be remotelycontrollable. 
Capacitive dividers in the bushing tothe bushingto 
the cable terminal compartment are to allow safe 
testing for dead state at the panel front. The degree 
of protection of the switchgear must not be reduced 
here. 
Gas Compartment Technology 
The sealed gas compartment must have its own pr
essure relief device which prevents uncontrolled 
bursting of the gas compartment when an accident
al arc occurs. The manufacturer must guarantee a 
sufficient pressure reserve between the operating pressure of the pressure relief devices and the bursting 

pressure of the container. 
The gas compartment must be tightly sealed. The filling pr
essure is to be such that
 at least 30 years service 
is guaranteed without the necessity of refilling. The de
sign of the HV compartment 
shall be such that no  
disruptive  discharge  will  occur  between  live  part
s and between live parts and earth even at atmospheric 
pressure at maximum system voltage. 
The  pressure  of  the  SF6  gas  is  to  be  monitored  inside  the  gas  compartment  by  means of pressure-
gauge boxes or temperature compensated sensor with se
lf-supervision. In this way, complete temperature 
compensation can be achieved. Any pressure drop be
yond the safe level as specified by the manufacturer 
shall be indicated in the form of sound and light alarm. Each Bus-section shall have individual pressure 

monitoring arrangement. 
Locking Devices Three-position     disconnectors     (ON-OFF-EARTH)     must     be     mechanically     and electrically  locked 
and  against the circuit breaker 
The inductive type Cast-resin insulated Voltage 
transformer shall be mounted outside the primary 
enclosure. The VTs can be plugged into the bus bar. 
The Voltage transformer on bus bar must be designed 
for 80% Power frequency withstand voltage so that repeat tests can be carried out on the bus bar without 
removal of the transformer. However, the voltage transformer on bus bar must be capable of withstanding 

over 100% power frequency withstand volt
age under normal operating conditions. 
Cable termination shall be totally insulated. Provision sh
ould be kept for plug-in connection of at least two 
cable per phase. 
The LV compartment shall be made of high quality sh
eet steel with powdered coated painting with 
sufficient space for mounting secondary equipment. 
The complete switchgear must be compact in dimens
ion as space is very limited. Also the Switchgear 
should be suitable for future extension or replacem
ent of panels without affecting the gas enclosures.

topology 
i.e.  on  the  positions   of  the  circuit  breakers   and/or  the  isolators.   The  correct   
voltage   
for synchronising  and  energising  is  derived  from  the  auxiliary  switches  of  the  
circuit  
breakers, 
isolator,  and earthing  switch and shall be selected  automatically  by the 
control  and 
protection IED.
 7.2.9.2  HMI Functions

tion but in any case it 
will not be less than 3 nos. The manufact
urer will provide all arrangements for 
the testing of transformers desired by the purchaser in his factory. 
7.4.2.7.4
 If the results of any transformer exceeds  
the specified losses and impedance (each 
component loss exceeds more than 15% or
 total loss exceeds more than 10% of 
the specified losses or percentage impe
dance exceeds 4±10% then the whole lot 
will be rejected or on request of the supplier/manufacturer every transformer may be 
tested (Transformer losses, percentage im
pedance, vector group test etc.) at his 
factory premises/CERS, BPDB by the 
WZPDCL inspection team. If the said 
transformers are tested by the WZPDCL inspection team at the 

manufacturers/suppliers premises, then the testing fees at the rate of Tk. 2000/-

(Two thousand) per transformer shall be
 paid by the supplier through invoice in 
advance. If the said transformers are tested at CERS, WZPDCL all the expenditure 
for carrying, loading/unloading and testing fees fixed by the CERS are to be borne

    1 Measured Average No Load Loss = [Sum 
of the measured No-load losses of 
the tested transformer(s) exceeding the specified No- 

load loss ÷ Nos. of tested transformer(s) which 

exceeds the specified No-load loss] 
 2 Measured Average Full Load Loss =        
[Sum of the measured 
Full-load losses of the 
tested transformer(s
) which exceeding the 
specified Full-load loss ÷ Nos. of tested 
transformer(s) which exc
eeds the specified Full- 
load loss]  It is to be noted that if the measured value 
found less than or equal to
 specified value, no 
benefits will be given to the supplier/ manufact
urer. In this case, the tested transformers 
whose loss (No load loss or Full load loss or 
Both) have not exceed the specified loss, will 
not be taken into account for averaging the

estimated cost or unbalanced as a result of front loading in the 

opinion of the TEC, the TEC may require the Tenderer to produce 

detailed breakdown of unit price or rates for any or all items of 
the BOQ, to demonstrate the internal consistency of those 
prices with the construction methods and schedule proposed. 

After evaluation of the breakdown of the unit price or rates, taking 

into consideration the schedule of estimated Contract payments, 

the Employer may require that the amount of the Performance 

Security set forth in ITT Sub Clause 61.2 be increased at the

the available budget, the Tenderer is not obliged to accept the 
award and shall not be penalised in any way for un-accepting 
the proposed award.

price fails the post-qualification, the TEC shall make a similar 

determination for the Tenderer offering the next  lowest evaluated 

Tender price and so on from the remaining responsive 

Tenders, provided that, 
(a) such action shall only be taken if the evaluated costs of the 
Tenders under consideration are acceptable to the 

Employer; (b) when the point is reached whereby the evaluated costs of 
the remaining responsive Tenders are significantly higher
