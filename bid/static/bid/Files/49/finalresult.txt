into consideration. 
54.8  In the event that there is a tie for the lowest price and none of 
the Tenderers has the record of  past performance with the

the available budget, the Tenderer is not obliged to accept the 

award and shall not be penalised in any way for un-accepting 

the proposed award. 
56.Post- qualification 56.1  After determining the lowest evaluated responsive Tender in 
accordance with ITT Clause 55, the Employer™s TEC shall carry

price fails the post-qualification, the TEC shall make a similar 
determination for the Tenderer offering the next  lowest evaluated 

Tender price and so on from the remaining responsive 

Tenders, provided that, 
(a) such action shall only be taken if the evaluated costs of the 
Tenders under consideration are acceptable to the 
Employer; (b) when the point is reached whereby the evaluated costs of 
the remaining responsive Tenders are significantly higher

   Bid Doc for 33kV SS(Vol-2 of 2)                                  322                                                     SPDSP,
 WZPDCL design, supply and installation including 
excavation, back filling and temporary 
reinforcement of earthing system and connections
 to electrical apparatus at the substation. 
Also included the lightning protection scheme 
and the provision of portable earthing devices. 
 The contractor shall be required 
to undertake all necessary earth 
resistively tests at the sub- 
station sites and from the tests result to unde
rtake the design of the earthing system. The 
design as well as providing safe passage to earth
 for the stated earth fault currents, shall 
also include calculation of step, touch and m
esh potentials, which shall be within the 
allowable limits of the standards quoted in the specification. 
 The design calculations of step, touch and mesh
 potentials accompanied by full installation 
drawings and material requirement schedules, 
shall be submitted to and receive the approval 
of the Engineer before materials pr
ocurement or installation commences. 
b.       SOIL SURVEY 
The preliminary tender design 
shall be based on a value of 100 ohm-m soil resistivity. 
Not later than one month after the site has been handed over for access, the Contractor shall 
carry out an earth resistivity survey of the 
sites and report in writing to the Engineer in 
accordance with the approved program. The repor
t shall detail the methods  and instruments 
used and the results of the surveys. Based on th
e results the Contractor shall include in the 
report his proposal for the resistiveties to be 
used in the design  of  the earthing system. 
The surveys shall show the variation of resistiv
ity across the site and with the depth below the 
site. The Contractor shall consider if there is a need to model the resistivity in two layers and if 
there is any advantage in the use of deep rod electrodes. 
The surveys shall also determine the depth a
nd nature of any underlying rock, which may 
limit the depth for driving earth rods or if boring will be necessary for installing earth rods. 
The weather conditions prior to and at the time
 of the surveys shall be recorded in the 
report and an assessment made of the seas
onal variations in resistivity based on 
meteorological data for the area. The program for 
the project should, as far as possible, time 
the resistivity surveys to take place during a dry season. 
The report should also state if there are any i
ndications that the ground is corrosive to bare 
copper. The report shall be approved by the Engineer
 before proceeding with the design of the 
earthing

ed for approval of the Engineer and shall be 
based on the methods given in the standards 
listed. The calculations shall include the 
   Bid Doc for 33kV SS(Vol-2 of 2)                                  323                                                     SPDSP,
 WZPDCL following parameters:-  earth resistance of the whole system and of its components. 
 earth potential rise 
 step, touch and mesh potentials insi
de and outside the perimeter fence 
 requirements for a high resistance surface layer 
 conductor ratings 
Earthing points shall be provided such that the co
mbined resistance of the earth grid and all 
other earthing points does not exceed 0.5 ohm during the dry season. 
The earth potential rises shall not exceed the CHIT limits appropriate to the classification of 
the system unless special precautions are taken to cater for transferred potentials. 
Step, touch and mesh potentials shall be within the permitted limits calculated in 
accordance with the standards given in
 IEEE 80 for the proposed surface layer. 
 ii)      Earth Electrode 
The earth electrode shall comprise
 a system of bare conductors forming a mesh buried near the 
surface of the ground and supplemented, if required, by one or more of the following 

electrodes:-  a system of interconnected rods driven into the ground. 
 a mesh system of bare conductors buried in the ground. 
 structural metal work in direct contact with the ground. 
 reinforcing steel in
 buried concrete.  a system of bare conductors buried near
 the surface of the ground outside the 
perimeter fence. 
iii)    Mesh System 
The mesh system shall be designed with above to limit touch, step and mesh potentials 
taking into account the combined length of
 the mesh conductors, 
other buried conductors and rods but excluding any buried 
conductors outside the perimeter 
fence. Due regard shall be 
given to non-linear distribution of the fault current giving rise to the highest potentials at mesh 

corners. 
The rating of the mesh conductors shall be compat
ible with the fault currents after allowing 
for parallel paths of hard drawn high conductivity copper strip with a minimum conductor 

size of 150 mm
2. The conductor shall be installed 
in trenches excavated by the contractor to a depth of 500 
mm. The system will be installe
d after all foundations 
have been laid and 
the site filled to 
100 mm below finished level. When the earthing 
grid has been laid and back filled, bricks 
will be laid up to finished site level. Wher
e the excavated material is rocky or may be 
difficult to consolidate, the back filling  sha
ll be carried out using other material to the 
approval of the Engineer. The cost of such mate
rial shall be deemed to be included in the 
Contract. iv)    Interconnected Rods 
If the design calculations show that a mesh alone
 is unable to limit the required values, then 
the mesh shall be supplemented by the use of 
interconnected earthing rods driven into the 
ground or installed in bored holes. 
    Bid Doc for 33kV SS(Vol-2 of 2)                                  324                                                     SPDSP,
 WZPDCL Rods shall be installed inside the perimete
r fence to enclose the maximum possible area 
compatible with the earthing of any metallic fe
nce. (The spacing between rods shall not be 
less than their length, unless rating consider
ations determine othe
rwise). The copper rod 
electrodes of 15mm diameter shall be interconne
cted in groups of four to eight rods by 
insulated copper conductors and 
non-ferrous clamps to form a ring. Each group shall be 
connected to the mesh by dup
licate insulated copper conductor 
via disconnecting test links. 
Individual rods may be connected directly
 to the mesh, provided the rod can be 
disconnected for testing. Rods installed in bored holes may be used to 
reach lower resistivity ground strata at depths 
beyond the reach of driven rods or where rock 
is encountered and it is not possible to drive 
rods. After installing the rod the bored hole sha
ll be back-filled with a low resistivity liquid 
mixture, which shall not shrink after pouring,
 to ensure good contact between the rod and 
the ground for the life of the installation. 
The resistance and rating of individual rods and 
the combined resistance of the groups of rods 
in the proposed design shall be calculated and th
e rating of the interconnecting conductors shall 
not be less than that of the group of rods with a minimum conductor size of 70 mm
2. The calculation of potentials in the design of th
e complete installation shall be made without 
the group of rods with the lowest estimated 
resistance to simulate the condition with the 
group disconnected for testing. 
          v)    Other Conductors 
As an alternative to rods to supplement a me
sh, additional bare copper conductors with a 
cross-section area of not less than 150mm
2 may be used. They shall be buried in the ground 
within the perimeter fence to enclose the maxi
mum possible area compatible with the earthing 
of any metallic fence. Such conductors may 
be laid below the mesh, below foundations or 
in areas where there is no plant. It shall be shown by calculation that the step potentials are low 
in such areas. 
The conductor shall be in a ring, or a part of
 a ring, with at least two widely separated 
connections to the mesh or other parts of the earthing system. 
vi )    Reinforcing Steel 
The reinforcing steel in the foundations of 
buildings containing the primary electrical 
equipment may be used as auxiliary electrodes, subject to the approval of the Engineer. The 
contractor shall show in the design calculations that the fault currents and d/c stray currents 

will not damage the structure. 
Steel reinforcing mesh in the floors of the build
ing may also be used for the control of step 
and touch potentials within the building 
subject to approval of the Engineer. 
vii)      Conductors Outside Perimeter Fence 
If the design calculations show that the step and touch potentials outside the perimeter 
fence or wall exceed the limits, than additiona
l bare conductors shall be buried in the ground 
outside the fence in the form of rings encircling the whole site. 
The distance of the conductors from the fen
ce and the depth shall be determined in the 
design to ensure that step and touch potentials are within the limits. 
The minimum conductor size shall be 75mm
2 copper and shall be connected to the fence or 
the mesh with 75mm
2 conductors at each corner of the site
 and at intervals of not more than 
100m. These conductors shall not be included 
in the calculations
 called for above.

measured transformer losses 
are within the specified value or within the following 
tolerance with deduction of money from the quoted/ contract price as below : 
7.3.2.7.1
 Each component loss (No load loss or 
Full load loss) may exceed up to 15% of 
   Bid Doc for 33kV SS (Vol-2 of 2)                             362                                                   SPDSP, WZPDC
L    the specified component loss, provided that
 the total losses cannot be exceeded 10% 
of the specified total losses. 
7.3.2.7.2
 Percentage Impedance may vary up to ± 10 % of the specified value. 
7.3.2.7.3
 The purchaser can carryout the testing of an
y no. of transformers during pre-delivery 
inspection. But, the testing 
of transformers during pre-delivery inspection will not be 
less than 10% at random basis of the transf
ormer ready for inspec
tion but in any case it 
will not be less than 3 nos. The manufact
urer will provide all arrangements for 
the testing of transformers desired by the purchaser in his factory. 
7.3.2.7.4
 If the results of any transformer exceeds  
the specified losses and impedance (each 
component loss exceeds more than 15% or
 total loss exceeds more than 10% of 
the specified losses or percentage impe
dance exceeds 4±10% then the whole lot 
will be rejected or on request of the supplier/manufacturer every transformer may be 

tested (Transformer losses, percentage im
pedance, vector group test etc.) at his 
factory premises/CERS, BPDB by the 
WZPDCL inspection team. If the said 
transformers are tested by the WZPDCL inspection team at the 
manufacturers/suppliers premises, then the testing fees at the rate of Tk. 2000/-

(Two thousand) per transformer shall be
 paid by the supplier through invoice in 
advance. If the said transformers are tested at CERS, WZPDCL all the expenditure 

for carrying, loading/unloading and testing fees fixed by the CERS are to be borne 
by the supplier in advance. After completion of
 the test, the transformer passes the test 
will be properly sealed by the inspection team. The supplier will be liable to protect 

those seal up to delivery to th
e WZPDCL™s designated Store(s). 
The transformers which pass the tests w
ill be accepted by WZPDCL subject to 
fulfillment of the other qualification criteria as per contract. The remaining 

transformers failed to qualify the tests will be rejected. 
7.3.2.7.5
 If the measured loss(es) (No load loss or
 Full load loss or Both) of the tested 
sample transformer(s) during factory test witness by the WZPDCL's inspection team 

and test performed by BUET/ DUET/ CUET/ KUET/ RUET exceed the specified loss 

(No load loss or Full load loss or Both) but 
remain within acceptable limit as specifiec 
in clause 7.11(i) 
& (ii), then an amount will be
 deducted from the Contract price for the loss(s) exceeding 
the specified loss(s) (No load loss or 
Full load loss or Both) according to the 
following formula : 
Amount to be deducted from the Contract price 

=    Contract Price x {(Measured Loss 
- specified Loss) ÷ specified Loss} x %MT 
Where, Contract 
Price =Total Contract Price 
 Measured 
Loss =Measured Average No-load Loss
*  1  
+ Measured Average Full 
Load Loss* 2.  Specified 
Loss =Specified No Load Loss + 
Specified Full load loss 
%MT (Percentage of Monetized Transformer) = % of the Monetized Transformer found 
during factory test witness by the WZPDCL's inspection team and test performed by 
BUET/ DUET/ CUET/ KUET/ RUET whose measured loss(es) (No load loss or Full 

load loss or Both) exceed the specified loss (N
o load loss or Full load loss or Both) but 
remain within acceptable limit. For example : 
If total no. of transformers to be inspected 
is 100 and the no. of selected transformers during pre-delivery inspection is 10, 8 nos.  
are  found within the specified losses and 
2 nos. are found exceeding the specified 
   Bid Doc for 33kV SS (Vol-2 of 2)                             363                                                   SPDSP, WZPDC
L    losses then the 
%MT will be (2/10)x100=20% 
 1 Measured Average No Load Loss = [Sum 
of the measured No-load losses of 
the tested transformer(s) exceeding the specified No- 

load loss ÷ Nos. of tested transformer(s) which 

exceeds the specified No-load loss] 
 2 Measured Average Full Load Loss =        
[Sum of the measured 
Full-load losses of the 
tested transformer(s
) which exceeding the 
specified Full-load loss ÷ Nos. of tested 

transformer(s) which exc
eeds the specified Full- 
load loss]  It is to be noted that if the measured value 
found less than or equal to
 specified value, no 
benefits will be given to the supplier/ manufact
urer. In this case, the tested transformers 
whose loss (No load loss or Full load loss or 
Both) have not exceed the specified loss, will 
not be taken into account for averaging the 
measured loss for using the above formula.

ssary system control and data acquisition functions. 
It shall include communication gateway to inter- bay-bus
, intelligent electronic devices (IED) for bay control 
and protection as shown in the enclosed general system architecture drawing. 
The communication gateway shall secure control from
 and information flow to remote network control 
centres. The inter-bay bus, configured as a star co
nnection (via star couplers) shall provide independent 
station-to-bay and bay-to-bay  data exchange. The bay le
vel intelligent electronic devices (IED) for protection 
and control shall be directly connected to the instru
ment transformer without any interposing equipment and 
perform control, protection, and monitoring functions subj
ect to a detail proposal approved by the Engineer. 
The IED™s for protection and control f
unctions shall maintain high availability and reliability together with bay 
independence through extensive self-supervi
sion and state-of-the-art technology. 
The system shall be capable of having its computing power increased in the future by the addition of

submitted.
 The manufacturing  phase of the SA shall be concluded  by a Factory Acceptance  Test (FAT). 
The 
purpose  is to ensure  that the Contractor  has interpreted  the specified  requirements  
correctly. 
The general  philosophy  shall  be to deliver  a system  to site only  after  it has been  
thoroughly 
tested  and  its  specified  performance  has  been  verified  with  site  conditions  
simulated  to  
the extent possible in a test lab. If the FAT involves only a certain portion of the 
system for 
practical 
reasons,  it has to be assured  that this
 test configuration  contains  at least 
one unit of each 
and every type of equipment incorporated  in the delivered 
system.
 If the complete system consists of parts from various suppliers,   the supplier shall 
arrange 
interoperability 
test at factory  during stage inspection  or FAT. The complete  system  test 
shall

The position of each switchgear, e.g. circuit breaker, isolator, earthing switch, etc., shall be 
permanently supervised. Every detected change of position shall be immediately visible on the 

screen in the single-line diagram, recorded in th
e event list, and a hard copy printout shall be 
produced. Alarms shall be initiated in cases when spontaneous position changes have taken place. 
Each position of an apparatus shall be indicated 
using two binary auxiliary normally closed (NC) 
and normally open (NO) contacts
. An alarm shall be initiated if these position indications are 
inconsistent or indicate an excessive running time of the operating mechanism to change position. 
7.5.9.1.3  Interlocking
The  interlocking   function  prevents   unsafe  operation   of  apparatuses   such  as  isolators   
and 
earthing  switches  within  a bay or station  wide.  The operation  of the switchgear  shall 
only be possible when certain conditions are fulfilled. The interlocking function is required to 
be decentralised  so that it does not depend  on a central  control  device.  
Communication 
between 
the various bays for the station interlocking  shall take place via bay 
communication 
system. 
An 
override  function  shall be provided,  which can be enabled  to by-pass  the 
interlocking  
function 
via a key/password,  in cases of maintenance  or emergency 
situations.

rms 
values for voltage (U) and current (I) shall be 
calculated
  7.5.9.1.5   Event and Alarm Handling:
Events and alarms shall be generated either by the switchgear, by the control devices and by 
the 
station  level  unit. They  shall  be recorded  in an event  list in the station  HMI.  Alarms  shall  
be 
recorded  in a separate  alarm list and appear  on the screen.  All or a freely selectable  group  
of events and alarms shall also be printed out on an event printer. The alarms and events shall 
be time tagged  with a time resolution  of 1 ms. The time tagging  shall be done at the lowest 
level 
where the event occurs and the information shall be distributed with the time 
tagging.
 7.5.9.1.6  Time Synchronization:
The time within the SA shall be set via a GPS Clock Receiver connected directly to the Bay 
Level 
LAN.  The  time  shall  then  be distributed  to the  
control/protective 
devices  via the  high  
speed 
optic fibre bus. An accuracy of ±1 ms within the station is 
required.
 7.5.9.1.7    Synchronism and Energizing Check
The synchronism and energising check functions shall be distributed to the control 
and/or 
protective devices and shall have the following 
features:

bus
  Settings for manual close command and auto-reclose command shall be               
adaptable 
to the operating times of the specific 
switchgear.
 7.5.9.1.8    Voltage Selection
The voltages, which are relevant for the synchrocheck  functions, depend on the station 
topology 
i.e.  on  the  positions   of  the  circuit  breakers   and/or  the  isolators.   The  correct   
voltage   
for synchronising  and  energising  is  derived  from  the  auxiliary  switches  of  the  
circuit  
breakers, 
isolator,  and earthing  switch and shall be selected  automatically  by the 
control  and 
protection IED.
 7.5.9.2  HMI Functions 
7.5.9.2.1  General
 The  operator  station  HMI  shall  provide  basic 
 functions  for  supervision  and  control  of  
the 
substation. The operator shall give commands to the switchgear via the station monitor with

The process  status of the substation  in terms of actual values  of currents,  voltages,  
frequency, 
active and reactive powers as well as the positions of circuit breakers, isolators and 
transformer 
tap changers are displayed in the station single line 
diagram.
 In  order  to ensure  a high  degree  of security  against  unwanted  operation,  a special  "select  
Œ before  - execute"  command  procedure  shall be provided.  After the "selection"  of a switch,  
the 
operator  shall be able to recognise  the selected  device on the screen and all other 
switchgear
