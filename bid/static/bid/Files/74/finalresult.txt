So, we think that, members will choose a Lead Partner who has theexPerience of tumkey project management and will have the ability to supporta tumkey project and will have the financial ability to manage a project. lt isvital to keep the option open for nominating the Lead Partrrer through thediscussion between the members rather than restricting it to make the metermanufacturer as tle Lead Partner.Henee the clause l8.l may be amendeci and nomination of LeadPartner mav be left with JV Fartners oniy.As per tender.L7The foreign exchange component oftheContract Price will be paid out of anirrevocable and unconditional Letterof Credit to be established in favourof the Lead Partner.ln our country very often it happens that Lead Partner of the JV delegatespower through execution of a Separate Power of Attomey authorizing anyolher local partner ol the JV Lo receive payment through L/C against contract.Also it is a common practice of the local banks to open L/C in foreign curencyand payment is made through Foreign Demand Draft (FDD) drawn onBangiadesh Bank.
