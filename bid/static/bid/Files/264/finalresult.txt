The Tenderer is required to provide timely clarification or substantiation of the

information that is essential for effective evaluation of its qualifications. It is the

responsibility of the Tenderer to provide in writing the clarification or substantiation

which should reach KPLC within five (5) days from the date of KPLC’s query. Such

writing may include by electronic mail, facsimile or postal mail. Should there be no

conclusive response within this period, it shall result in the Tenderer’s disqualification.

Save as is provided in this paragraph and paragraph 3.26 above, no Tenderer shall contact

KPLC on any matter related to its Tender, from the time of the tender opening to the time

the successful Tenderer is announced.

Any effort by a Tenderer to influence KPLC in its decisions on tender evaluation, tender

comparison, tender recommendation(s) or signing of Agreement may result in the

disqualification of the Tenderer.

Preliminary Tender Evaluation

Prior to the detailed Technical and Financial evaluation, KPLC will determine the

substantial responsiveness of each Tender. For purposes of this tender, a substantially

responsive Tender is one that conforms to the requirements of Preliminary Evaluation.

KPLC’s determination of a Tender’s responsiveness is to be based on the contents of the

Tender itself without recourse to extrinsic evidence.

KPLC will examine the Tenders to determine whether they conform to the Preliminary

Evaluation Criteria set out in the Section VI Evaluation Criteria.

Notwithstanding the contents of the foregoing sub-paragraphs, if a Tender is not

substantially responsive, it will be rejected at the earliest stage of evaluation by KPLC

and cannot subsequently be made responsive by the Tenderer by correction of any non.

conformity.

Minor Deviations, Errors or Oversights

KPLC may waive any minor deviation in a Tender that does not materially depart from

the requirements of the Goods and or services set out in the Tender Document.

Such minor deviation -

3,27.2.1 shall be quantified to the extent possible,

3,27.2.2 shalll be taken into account in the evaluation process, and,

3,27.2.3 shall be applied uniformly and consistently to all qualified Tenders duly
received by KPLC.

KPLC may waive errors and oversights that can be corrected without affecting the

substance of the Tender.

Technical Evaluation of Tenders

KPLC will evaluate and compare the Tenders that have been determined to be
substantially responsive in compliance to the Technical requirements set out in the Tender
Document.

if the Tenderer fails to extend the validity of the tender security where KPLC has extended
the tender validity period in accordance with the Tender Document.

\TES TO TENDERERS AND BANKS.

Please note that should the Tender Security (LC) omit any of the above conditions the LC
shall not be accepted and shall be rejected by KPLC. For the avoidance of doubt, such
rejection will be treated as non-submission of the LC where such LC is required in the
Tender.

Itis the responsibility of the Tenderer to sensitize its issuing bank on the need to respond
directly and expeditiously to any queries from KPLC. The period for response shall not
exceed three (3) days from the date of KPLC’s query. Should there be no conclusive
response by the Bank within this period, such Tenderer’s Tender Security shall be deemed
as invalid and the bid rejected.

The issuing bank should address its response or communication regarding the bond
to KPLC at the following e-mail address — “guarantees@ kple.co.ke”

The Tender validity period is one eighty (180) days as set out in the Invitation to Tender
(at Section I of the Tender document) or as otherwise may be extended by KPLC.
Therefore, the Tender Security must at all times be valid for at least 30 days beyond the

tender validity period.

All Guarantees issued by foreign banks must be confirmed by a local bank in Kenya.

Corrupt or Fraudulent Practices

KPLC requires that Tenderers observe the highest standard of ethics during the

procurement process and execution of contracts. When used in the present Regulations,

the following terms are defined as follows: -

a) “Corrupt practice” means the offering, giving, receiving or soliciting of anything
of value to influence the action of public official in the procurement process or in
contract execution;

b) “Fraudulent practice” means a misrepresentation of facts in order to influence a
procurement process or the execution of a contract to the detriment of KPLC, and
includes collusive practice among Tenderers (prior to or after Tender submission)
designed to establish tender prices at artificial non-competitive levels and to
deprive KPLC of the benefits of free and open competition.

KPLC will nullify its notification of award if it determines that the Tenderer

recommended has engaged in corrupt or fraudulent practices in competing for the contract

in question.

Further, a Tenderer who is found to have indulged in corrupt or fraudulent practices risks

being debarred from participating in public procurement in Kenya.
